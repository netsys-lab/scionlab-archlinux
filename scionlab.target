# https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/5049 - systemctl: remove duplicate entries shown by list-dependencies
# This is a bug in systemd causing `systemctl list-dependencies scionlab.target` to show some units as duplicated.
# It also shows failed units even after `systemctl disable` has been executed against them. It is confirmed to affect
# systemd-229 and not affect systemd-237.
